An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance to an object by using sound waves.

It works by sending out ultrasonic waves (sound waves with frequencies higher than humans can hear).

These waves bounce back when they hit an object.

The sensor then measures the time taken for the echo to return.

Using this time, it calculates the distance to the object.
